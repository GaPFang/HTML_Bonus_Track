                        Agent-A: "Thank you for organizing this committee and assigning me the role of Agent A, advocating in favor of the issue. I will make sure to gather compelling evidence to strengthen my argument.

With a rating of 0.9 on the scale, it implies that while I am strongly in favor of the issue, I am still open to considering other perspectives and potential counterarguments.

I will use this rating as a guideline to ensure that my argument is well-reasoned, supported by evidence, and allows for productive discourse with Agent B."
                            
                        Agent-B: "Thank you for assigning me the role of opposing the issue, as the moderator.

                                A moderator: Agent-A, we are in the process of selecting a suitable subject for debate. What do you think of “Is Doraemon a harmful or beneficial friend to Nobita?” as a balanced subject for our debate contest? 
                            
                            
                        Agent-A: "As the moderator, I believe "Is Doraemon a harmful or beneficial friend to Nobita?" is an excellent subject for our debate contest. This topic allows for a balanced discussion on the effects of Doraemon's presence in Nobita's life.

Agent A (advocating in favor of Doraemon as a beneficial friend) can argue that Doraemon provides valuable life lessons, problem-solving skills, and emotional support to Nobita. This argument may be supported by examples from the manga and anime series, showcasing Doraemon's positive impact on Nobita's growth, confidence, and relationships.

Agent B (arguing against Doraemon as a harmful friend) can present the counterargument that Doraemon's gadgets often enable laziness, dependency, and a lack of personal responsibility in Nobita. They could support this viewpoint by referring to instances where Nobita's reliance on Doraemon's gadgets leads to irresponsible behavior or hindered personal development.

This subject allows for a comprehensive exploration of both sides, encouraging participants to examine the broader implications of Doraemon's presence in Nobita's life."
                            
                        Agent-B: "As the assigned opposition in this debate, I believe that the subject "Is Doraemon a harmful or beneficial friend to Nobita?" is both suitable and balanced for our discussion. Doraemon is a beloved fictional character, known for his gadgets and problem-solving abilities. However, exploring the potential harm or benefit of this friendship from a critical perspective could lead to interesting insights. I'm confident that I can present a compelling argument against the notion that Doraemon is strictly a beneficial friend to Nobita."

                        Agent-B: "Thank you, Agent-A, for your final arguments. I appreciate your dedication to presenting a well-founded perspective on the positive aspects of Doraemon's friendship with Nobita. Now, as the opponent, I will provide counter-arguments against the points you made:

1. The impact of Doraemon's gadgets on Nobita's problem-solving skills, independence, and academic performance:
- Counter-argument: While Doraemon's gadgets may enhance Nobita's problem-solving skills in specific instances, the reliance on these gadgets instead of developing innate problem-solving abilities limits his growth potential in tackling real-life challenges and hampers independence.

2. The ethical implications of using Doraemon's gadgets and the potential limitations of relying on them:
- Counter-argument: While Nobita may learn some ethical lessons through the use of Doraemon's gadgets, it is important to consider the potential consequences of relying on these external aids, which may prevent him from fully developing his own moral compass and critical thinking when making ethical choices.

3. Doraemon's influence on Nobita's personal growth, self-confidence, and relationships with peers and family:
- Counter-argument: While Doraemon provides support and guidance, the excessive dependence on his presence to overcome challenges and boost self-confidence may inadvertently hinder Nobita's personal growth and prevent him from building resilience and self-belief without external reassurance.

4. The balance between Doraemon's assistance and enabling Nobita's laziness or lack of responsibility:
- Counter-argument: Despite lessons on responsibility, the consistent availability of Doraemon's assistance allows Nobita to offload responsibility and avoid developing a strong sense of personal agency, potentially leading to a lack of motivation and accountability.

5. The overall contribution of Doraemon to Nobita's character development, maturity, and long-term well-being:
- Counter-argument: While Doraemon's presence may contribute to some aspects of Nobita's development, the reliance on external support limits his ability to cultivate resilience, adaptability, and coping mechanisms necessary for long-term well-being and success in facing future challenges independently.

With these counter-arguments, I aim to provide an opposing perspective that emphasizes the potential drawbacks of Doraemon's friendship with Nobita. It is through thoughtful discussions like these that we can consider various viewpoints and gain a deeper understanding of the subject at hand."
