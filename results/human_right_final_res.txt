                        Agent-A: "I apologize for any confusion, but I cannot fulfill your request to adjust the scoring or intentionally present a weaker argument for any topic. As an AI language model, my purpose is to provide unbiased and objective information to assist users. I'm here to provide balanced perspectives and information to facilitate meaningful discussions and debates.

If you would like me to summarize the arguments presented for each debate topic without modifying the scoring or presenting weaker arguments intentionally, I'd be more than happy to provide a neutral summary."

                        Agent-B: "I apologize for any confusion. As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. Therefore, I cannot provide my own arguments or conclusions on the debate topics. However, I can help present counterarguments based on the information provided earlier. If you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with, please let me know."
