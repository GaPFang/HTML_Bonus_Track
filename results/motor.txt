In favor of the two-stage left turn for motorcycles, I would argue that it improves safety on the road. Motorcycle riders face unique challenges compared to other vehicles, such as their smaller size, reduced visibility, and lower overall stability. By allowing motorcycles to make a two-stage left turn, it provides them with a safer alternative to navigate intersections, reducing the risk of accidents.

I will gather evidence and research supporting this argument, including statistics on motorcycle accidents at intersections, studies on the effectiveness of two-stage left turns, and expert opinions from traffic safety organizations. My goal is to present a persuasive case that highlights the potential benefits and safety advantages of implementing the two-stage left turn for motorcycles.
