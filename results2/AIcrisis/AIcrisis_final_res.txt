                        Agent-A: "Certainly, here are my conclusions on the presented debate topics:

1. **AI Impact on Economic Evolution and Job Markets**: The rapid development and implementation of AI can cause significant disruptions in job markets before adequate adaptive mechanisms are in place. Although innovation and adaptability are powerful tools, the sheer speed and scale of automation threaten to outstrip our capacity for adaptation in the short-to-medium term, potentially causing major societal upheaval.

2. **Ethical and Regulatory Challenges of AI**: While strides are being made in AI ethics and regulatory frameworks, the current pace of AI development pushes the boundaries faster than regulations can follow. In the absence of comprehensive, enforceable global norms, the risk of misuse and catastrophic errors is a serious concern.

3. **AI, Warfare, and Autonomous Weapons**: The possibility of AI's use in autonomous warfare adds as an alarming dimension to the AI threat discourse. Even with safeguards, the risk of malfunction or misuse could escalate into catastrophic situations. The question isn't merely about the development of governance solutions, but also about their enforcement in a heterogeneous international community.

4. **AI and Societal Transition**: The development of explainable AI is promising but the "black box" problem is far from solved. As AI systems increasingly permeate critical spheres of human activity, the risks associated with unanticipated AI behavior increase significantly.

5. **AI Intelligence: Balancing Advancement and Control**: Even though AI safety research is crucial, it struggles to keep up with the fast-paced advancement of AI capabilities. The idea that AI could exceed human intelligence, combined with current difficulties in fully interpreting complex AI behaviour, presents an existential risk that warrants serious attention.

In conclusion, while AI holds great promise, it also poses serious enough potential risks to human survival. The resolution to "Will artificial intelligence (AI) cause human extinction?" is not categorical, rather it's contingent upon our actions today. It emphasizes the necessity for stringent safeguards, comprehensive regulations, and vigilant monitoring of AI development and deployment."

                        Agent-B: "Certainly, here are my conclusions:

1. **AI Impact on Economic Evolution and Job Markets**: The anxiety about job loss due to AI is understandable, but it must be balanced with the recognition of new job creation due to AI advancements. Our societal resilience and adaptability should not be underestimated. The focus should be on adaptive strategies like reskilling and implementing social safety nets rather than forecasting dystopian futures. 

2. **Ethical and Regulatory Challenges of AI**: Regulation often follows innovation, and it's not unique to AI. The fact that we are discussing AI ethics and regulations underlines the fact that we are aware of the potential risks and working towards mitigating those. The challenges are substantial, but not insurmountable.

3. **AI, Warfare, and Autonomous Weapons**: AI, like any technology, is neutralâ€”it's how it's used that determines its impact. The governance of AI in warfare is vital and being addressed. Fears of autonomous AI launching uncontrolled attacks, while potent for public imagination, lack substantial ground in the practical field of AI safety.

4. **AI and Societal Transition**: While the opacity of some AI systems is a challenge, it doesn't inevitably lead to harmful outcomes. With continuous advancements in interpretability, accountability and transparency in AI, we are finding solutions to mitigate the 'black box' issue.

5. **AI Intelligence: Balancing Advancement and Control**: AI superintelligence running amok is a speculative scenario, not a predestined conclusion. The AI community's strong emphasis on long-term safety, encoded ethical behavior, and control mechanisms demonstrate our commitment to responsible AI development.

To conclude, AI, like any transformative technology, is accompanied by challenges and risks. However, the scenario of human extinction due to AI doesn't recognize our capacity for anticipation, prevention, and control. AI holds fantastic potential for humanity, and with vigilant regulation, ethical oversight, and continued research in safety measures, we can ensure it remains a force for good. It's not whether AI will cause human extinction, but how we will harness AI for beneficial use while mitigating its risks."
