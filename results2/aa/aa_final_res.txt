                        Agent-A: "Absolutely, here are my concluding points supporting the application of "all averaging" in dating payments:

1. **Financial Norms Evolution in Dating:** All Averaging" doesn't restrict the freedom of partners to tailor their financial practices but provides a platform where discussions on financial commitment in a relationship can be more open and fair, promoting modernized dating norms.

2. **Socioeconomic Impact and Fairness:** It is not an oversimplified solution but an opportunity to face the socio-economic disparities head-on. It can motivate the conversation on what financial fairness looks like in context of a couples' unique situation.

3. **Cultural Factors and the Global Perspective:** Instead of being imposed as a definitive solution, "all averaging" should be seen as a thought-provoking model for a much-needed dialogue on equal financial responsibility in dating, considering diverse cultural contexts.

4. **Psychological Implications and Relationship Dynamics:** All Averaging, when perceived as a common starting point rather than a strict rule, can encourage healthier financial conversations, minimize misunderstandings, and foster balanced power dynamics.

5. **All Averaging: Practicality and Legal Aspects:** The potential risks are worth considering, and any application of "all averaging" should be coupled with comprehensive research, and possibly legislative support. This concept prompts a re-evaluation of current practices, potentially driving necessary legal advancement. 

Overall, the concept of "all averaging" in dating payments is an invitation to foster equitable and open financial dialogues within relationships, prompting societal and legal progression."

                        Agent-B: "Surely, here are my concluding counter-arguments against the application of all averaging in dating payments:

1. **Financial Norms Evolution in Dating:** While all averaging can stimulate financial discussions, its inherent 'split-the-bill' premise may introduce an unwanted transactional component to personal relationships. It's essential to promote open financial dialogues without imposing a one-size-fits-all model.

2. **Socioeconomic Impact and Fairness:** While it provides an opportunity to address socio-economic disparities, all averaging can unintentionally amplify those disparities if it's not sensitively adjusted to accommodate differences in income levels. More personalized financial arrangements can offer fewer ambiguities and conflicts.

3. **Cultural Factors and the Global Perspective:** While all averaging may instigate conversations on equality, cultural sensitivity needs to be paramount. A single model might not respect the vast array of cultural practices related to dating and finances worldwide.

4. **Psychological Implications and Relationship Dynamics:** All averaging, even as a starting point, can subtly lay a foundation for financial transactionality in relationships, potentially sparking resentment or misunderstandings. Developing mutual financial arrangements, emerging organically from the relationship, can be more harmonious.

5. **All Averaging: Practicality and Legal Aspects:** While all averaging highlights the need for legal advancement in dating finances, concrete safeguards must be in place before promoting potentially risky models, to protect individuals within romantic relationships from exploitation or financial harm.

In conclusion, while all averaging's premise of sparking financial dialogue in relationships has its merits, its systematic application can introduce complexities and challenges that may outweigh its benefits. It's vital to treat each relationship individually, respecting its inherent dynamics rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.
