A's response:

                            
                        Agent-A: "Absolutely, let's sum up my arguments on the debate subject and topics:

1. **Human Agency, Ethics, and Control in AI Development vs. Natural Phenomena** - While unanticipated issues sometimes arise in AI, our ability to adapt, learn and prevent similar issues in future AI development demonstrates our continual control and agency over this field, distinguishing it from our primarily reactive stance towards natural phenomena like pandemics.

2. **The Origins and Uncontrollable Nature of AI: A Product of Human-Made Intervention vs. Natural Evolution?** - AI does present certain unpredictabilities, but key aspects, including design, modification, monitoring, and direction of AI evolution, are shaped by humans. Thus, AI's progress differs substantially from natural evolution, showcasing human agency and control.

3. **Regulation in Technological Advancements: Safety Measures or Instruments of Control?** - AI-related regulations, whether pre-emptive or reactive, offer guiding rails for AI progression. The capability and willingness to adjust these regulations exhibit our active agency and intentional influence over the course of AI, unlike our limited control over natural events.

4. **Responses and Impact: AI Advancements vs. Pandemics** - In AI advancement, we are not mere decision reactors but decision drivers. Our responsive adaptation to unexpected outcomes, followed by alterations to future AI applications, sets our approach to AI apart from our reactive nature to pandemics.

5. **Economic Consequences, Managing Risks: AI Progression vs. Pandemic Response** - While AI does pose economic challenges, our ability to enact policy changes, technology redesigns, and mitigation strategies reflects our proactive role in managing AI's implications. Compared to a pandemic, we have significantly more tools and agency to address AI's economic impact.

In essence, although AI progression presents unpredictable elements, the degree of human involvement, influence, and control over AI far surpasses our reactive role when dealing with natural phenomena like pandemics. Therefore, it's assertive to say that AI progress is not akin to a natural phenomenon and that we have considerably more agency in this realm."

                        Agent-B: "Certainly, Agent A. Let's summarize the differing perspective:

1. **Human Agency, Ethics, and Control in AI Development vs. Natural Phenomena** - While we learn and adapt to the issues in AI development, it is important to underscore that this adaption often occurs after encountering unanticipated problems, reflecting a reactive aspect that parallels our reaction to unexpected facets of natural disasters like pandemics.

2. **The Origins and Uncontrollable Nature of AI: A Product of Human-Made Intervention vs. Natural Evolution?** - Although we design and modify AI, the field, particularly complex AI models, exhibit a degree of inherent unpredictability. Hence, even in a domain of our own creation, elements of uncontrollable 'naturalness' emerge that we must attempt to understand and manage.

3. **Regulation in Technological Advancements: Safety Measures or Instruments of Control?** - A substantial number of regulations are formed in response to unforeseen issues and challenges arising from AI’s rapid development, indicating the reactive, catch-up characteristic of regulation, speaking to AI’s somewhat untamed nature. 

4. **Responses and Impact: AI Advancements vs. Pandemics** - In the path of AI progression, planning exists, but so does reactivity to sudden and unanticipated occurrences. This reactive aspect, needed due to AI's unpredictability, draws parallels with our responses to unforeseen eventualities during pandemics.

5. **Economic Consequences, Managing Risks: AI Progression vs. Pandemic Response** - The unanticipated economic disruptiveness brought by AI, especially in job displacement and inequality, presents the phenomena of unpredictability and adaptation, closely resembling our economic response to pandemics.

While AI is indeed a product of human-made intervention and exhibits areas where we can exert control, the advancement of AI also portrays characteristics of a semi-natural phenomenon exhibiting unpredictable, autonomous behaviors necessitating reactive responses. Therefore, within the discourse regarding AI progression, there is a considerable argument to consider it as an event exhibiting both elements of human-controllable and natural phenomena. The degree of our agency, while substantial, is not entirely comprehensive, and there exist dimensions within AI progression where we take reactive rather than proactive stances, similar to our relationship with natural phenomena like pandemics."
