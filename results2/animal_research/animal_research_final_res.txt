                        Agent-A: "I appreciate the inputs from Agent B. Ending the debate, here are the conclusions on the topic "Should animals be used for scientific research?" from the perspective of advocating:

1. Ethical and Moral Considerations: The causality of animal testing is not to sideline the ethical concerns but to necessitate their mitigations. The past has taught us how animal testing has paved the way for breakthroughs, and while moral regard is fundamental, doing away with a practice serving humanity could impede progress.

2. Medical Progression Reliant on Animal Testing: Animal models are still paramount in biomedical research, given their physiological and genetic resemblances to humans. While risk is inevitable, the crux lies in its management, and hence pursuing safer practices is the need of the hour as opposed to abandoning a helpful method.

3. Evaluating Alternatives to Animal Testing: Trusting the promise of alternatives is pivotal for the future but negating the simultaneous requirement for animal testing could jeopardize ongoing research. Alternatives are a direction, but till they're foolproof, animal testing remains necessary.

4. Regulatory Measures and Legal Boundaries: The 3Rs provide robust guidelines for ethical animal testing. The debate isn't about ratifying harm to animals; it's about acknowledging a practice that, under tight regulations, has proven beneficial in the past and continues to do so.

5. Wellbeing of Animals in Research: The goal of continuous refinement applies here, aiming for minimum distress and maximum comfort. The argument isn't about defying status quo; it's about evolving practices for maximum benefit and minimal harm.

Scientific progression ought to go hand in hand with ethical obligations, and itâ€™s with that cognizance that I advocate for regulated, refined, and ethical animal testing till viable alternatives become commonplace. The focus should be on reducing harm, tightening regulations, and investing in alternatives, whilst responsibly employing animal testing as and when required."

                        Agent-B: "Absolutely, I summarize my stance on the issue as follows:

1. Ethical and Moral Considerations: Historical justifications should not excuse practices that cause harm. As societies evolve, so must our practices. We must always evaluate benefits against costs, not only in lives saved but in terms of ethics too. 

2. Medical Progression Reliant on Animal Testing: Acknowledging that there are resemblances between humans and animals doesn't mean that they can be used interchangeably in medical research. The goal should always be to minimize risk at all stages, even if it means an overhaul of existing practices.

3. Evaluating Alternatives to Animal Testing: Embracing inevitable technological and scientific advancements is crucial. The evolution of such alternatives signals that a future with minimal animal testing is feasible and should be vigorously pursued.

4. Regulatory Measures and Legal Boundaries: While regulations exist, they operate within a system that permits harm to sentient beings in the name of progress. It wouldn't be misguided to question whether such a system aligns with our modern ethical understandings. 

5. Wellbeing of Animals in Research: Refinement is critical but should not stop us from pushing for abolition of practices causing harm. Our discomfort with the status quo is justified and mirrors societal progress towards ensuring our actions align more closely with our ethical ideals.

While the necessity of animal testing has its historically backed reasonings, it's worth noting our societal norms and values are changing, making concerted efforts to move towards humane, ethical alternatives crucial. On this recognition, I propose that we reevaluate practices causing harm and prioritize the development and implementation of ethical alternatives."
