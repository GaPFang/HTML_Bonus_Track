                        Agent-A: "Definitely, here are the closing arguments on the subject:

1. **Economic and Educational Impact of Bilingual Policies**: The investment in bilingual education is significant, but it provides a framework to cultivate future generations who are not only globally competent but also possess enhanced cognitive abilities. Bilingual policies aren't designed to replace other educational strategies but supplement them to create a more holistic educational experience.

2. **Taiwan in a Globalized Context**: Resource allocation for bilingual education is indeed a commitment, but the long-term benefits have the potential to greatly outpace the initial costs. English proficiency, complementing Taiwan's other strengths, can significantly enhance its global standing.

3. **Cultural Preservation versus Global Cultural Exchange**: While practical challenges exist, they do not dismiss the ideal that local language and culture can be successfully promoted alongside teaching English. Balancing cognitive load is crucial, and flexible strategies should be employed to accommodate different learners' needs.

4. **Governmental Role and Challenges in Promoting Bilingualism**: Adapting global strategies to Taiwan's unique context is indeed complex. However, the complexity doesn't nullify their potential value but instead underscores the need for a thoughtful and diligent approach to policy implementation.

5. **Long-Term Effects and Implementation of Bilingualism**: Striking a balance is indeed ambitious, and achieving the perfect bilingual scenario is challenging. However, acknowledging these challenges is the first step in creating mechanisms to address them effectively.

In conclusion, the arguments in favor of continuing the policy that aims to make Taiwan bilingual by 2030 revolve around careful and considerate implementation. This includes proper resource allocation, balancing educational demands, promoting local culture while teaching English, adapting global strategies to local contexts systematically, and ensuring inclusion and equality in language policies. The goal is not only for Taiwan to successfully engage with the world but also to cultivate a culture of bilingualism that enriches the lives of its citizens. The inherent risks and cultural implications have been considered alongside Taiwan's unique identity, values, and goals, deducing that the benefits of moving towards a bilingual society potentially outweigh the challenges.

                        Agent-B: "Absolutely, Agent A. Based on our vibrant discussion, here are my concluding remarks in opposition to the policy of making Taiwan bilingual by 2030:

1. **Economic and Educational Impact of Bilingual Policies**: Significant investment in bilingual education needs stringent scrutiny against potential future benefits, which might not be as substantial or guaranteed as projected. A more holistic educational experience can be introduced by focusing on various educational strategies and tools rather than heavily leaning on bilingualism.

2. **Taiwan in a Globalized Context**: English proficiency, while useful, may not essentially leverage Taiwan's global position as compared to the investment and shift in societal fabric it requires. Enhancing Taiwan's global standing can be approached through building on its unique strengths and economic strategies rather than employing large-scale language policy.

3. **Cultural Preservation versus Global Cultural Exchange**: The practical challenges of balancing language learning are significant. The risk of the local language and culture receiving less importance over time is real and could lead to irreversible consequences, diluting the rich cultural heritage of Taiwan.

4. **Governmental Role and Challenges in Promoting Bilingualism**: While the global strategies provide learning references, the unique social-cultural circumstances in Taiwan necessitate a custom-made approach which may or may not involve tilting towards bilingualism. The complex task of ensuring governmental initiatives in bilingualism won't inadvertently introduce societal or cultural rifts cannot be undermined.

5. **Long-Term Effects and Implementation of Bilingualism**: The ambitious target of striking a perfect balance should be considered against the backdrop of risks involved. The bilingual scenario, if deemed necessary, requires careful planning and a slow phased approach considering the multifaceted impacts on the society.

In conclusion, while the benefits of a bilingual society are quite apparent, the magnitude of the associated risks and challenges should not be lightly considered. For Taiwan, an individualized approach, which respects its unique cultural identity and socio-economic aspirations, might be of more relevance than simply adopting a global trend. The key lies in exploring all possible avenues and impacts before making long-lasting policy decisions. "
