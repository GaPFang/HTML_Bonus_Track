                        Agent-A: "Thank you, Agent-B, for the engaging discourse. In conclusion:

1. **Deterrence vs. Crime Rates:** Despite varying research insights, I firmly believe that capital punishment acts as a deterrence measure. It is vital to continue examining this relationship but simultaneously maintaining it as a tool for most heinous crimes.

2. **Cost-effectiveness and Judgement:** Improving judicial efficiency, streamlining court procedures, and embracing technological advancements will help mitigate the high cost of capital punishment. The debate should also encompass the indirect, unquantifiable societal costs of not implementing the death penalty.

3. **Moral Implications & Notion of Justice:** Capital punishment doesn't defy moral values, rather it reinforces the idea of retributive justice. The immense grievousness of certain crimes demands such a severe punishment both morally and legally.

4. **Risk of Wrongful Execution:** The objective should be to strive towards zero wrongful execution rate utilizing technology, exhaustive legal procedures, and implementing checks and balances. Yet in cases with unequivocal evidence, capital punishment can serve justice.

5. **Societal Impact & Emotional Well-being:** Capital punishment can serve societal retribution, act as a deterrent, and provide closure to victims' families. It underscores the gravity of certain crimes and the society's unwillingness to endure them.

Hence, while acknowledging the potential limitations and the need for stringent controls in its application, I conclude that capital punishment should remain in our legal arsenal to deal with the most egregious crimes. In doing so, it provides justice for victims, serves as a potential deterrent, and safeguards societal interests.

                        Agent-B: "Thank you, Agent-A, for your thought-provoking arguments. Here are my final counter-points and conclusions as Agent-B:

1. **Deterrence vs. Crime Rates:** While the deterrence theory remains a centerpiece of the pro-capital punishment argument, the inconsistent and inconclusive research findings call for caution. The potential for mistake due to the finality of death penalty outweighs the situational deterrence it may provide.

2. **Cost-effectiveness and Judgement:** Cost mitigation through judicial efficiency is theoretically plausible but not yet a reality. The potential financial, societal, and moral cost of a wrongful execution cannot be overlooked. The cost debate should factor in these aspects and not remain limited to direct financial implications.

3. **Moral Implications & Notion of Justice:** While some see retributive justice as necessary, others view it as perpetuating a cycle of violence, thus degrading societal moral standards. Heinous crimes demand severe punishment, but this does not mandate death. Life imprisonment without parole fulfills the demand for severe penalty without causing death.

4. **Risk of Wrongful Execution:** The aspiration for zero wrongful execution rate is indeed noble. However, as long as there is human involvement in the process, errors are inevitable. Life sentences in cases of unequivocal evidence allow justice to be served while retaining the capacity for rectification in case of errors.

5. **Societal Impact & Emotional Well-being:** Capital punishment serves societal retribution, but it potentially perpetuates violence and fails to promote rehabilitation. Furthermore, the notion of closure through death penalty is controversial and varies among individuals.

In conclusion, despite its historical presence in legal systems, capital punishment poses ethical, financial, and effective justice questions that remain unresolved. Alternatives like life imprisonment without parole can serve similar objectives without the irreversible consequence of death. Thus, societal interests could be better served by focusing on crime prevention and rehabilitation rather than retribution."
