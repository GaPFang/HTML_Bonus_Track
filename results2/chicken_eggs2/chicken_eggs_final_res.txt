                        Agent-A: "Certainly, here are my concluding arguments for each of the debate topics and the final conclusion:

1. **AI's Economic Impact and Effect on Employment**:
   - Even though AI’s impact on the job markets may initially seem disruptive, with the right governmental policies, investment in reskilling and upskilling, we can navigate this change just like we did during other industrial revolutions. The long-term results will likely be increased productivity and economic growth.

2. **Ethical and Privacy Implications of AI Advancement**:
   - Considering AI's rapid progression, interim protective measures, and the development of long-term comprehensive policies are crucial to protect user's privacy and to ensure ethical use of AI. Established guidelines and auditing systems could ensure transparency and accountability in AI operations. While it's challenging, humanity has faced and successfully overcome many such technological challenges in the past.

3. **AI in Healthcare**:
   - AI's capacity to revolutionize healthcare shouldn't be sidelined because of potential errors or challenges. All novel technologies bring about challenges that can be mitigated with careful planning, monitoring, and adaptation. The potential benefits, such as increased precision in diagnosis and personalized patient care, are groundbreaking.

4. **AI and Education**:
   - AI's utility in democratizing education and offering customized learning experiences justifies the necessary investments. While it's essential to consider potential privacy issues, those must be dealt with effective regulations instead of not utilizing AI’s potential to its full capacity in the educational sector.

5. **AI Ethics and Decision Making**:
   - Promotions of diversity in AI ethics and decision making are indeed challenging, but necessary. Conduits for public participation and efforts for industry-wide culture change can mitigate bias in AI systems, leading to more just and representative AI.

**Conclusion**: 
The journey of AI is reminiscent of all major technological advancements: initially disruptive, followed by adaptation and the eventual realization of its vast potential. It's not without challenges, but with careful planning, appropriate regulations, societal participation, and emphasis on ethics, AI can emerge as a tool of enormous societal benefit.

                        Agent-B: "Absolutely, here are my concluding arguments for each topic:

1. **AI's Economic Impact and Effect on Employment**: 
    - AI's impact on the economy needs careful handling. It's not enough to be optimistic about its potential for job creation. There are real concerns regarding job displacement that could lead to major social and economic disruption. Governments and organizations should proactively address the changes with approaches that ensure fair opportunities for all.

2. **Ethical and Privacy Implications of AI Advancement**:
    - While AI has the potential to revolutionize privacy and security, it also presents considerable ethical and privacy concerns. Debating around how this technology is used is crucial, considering the potential misuse of AI and the lack of universally accepted guidelines for AI ethics and privacy protection.

3. **AI in Healthcare**:
   - The prospect of AI in healthcare is indeed promising, but challenges around accuracy, patient safety, and data security cannot be downplayed. The implementation of AI in health systems must be cautious, and the complexity of AI algorithms demand rigorous testing and regulatory methods. 

4. **AI and Education**:
    - AI brings numerous benefits to education, yet there are significant concerns regarding the widening of educational disparities, privacy concerns, and the risk of dependency on AI technology. More consideration and comprehensive planning are needed to ensure that we do not inadvertently deepen existing educational inequities.

5. **AI Ethics and Decision Making**:
   - Issues of bias and representation in AI are significant and require not just technical solutions but industry-wide culture changes. Designing ethical guidelines for AI is an intricate issue that demands the involvement of diverse groups to prevent an imbalance in representation.

**Conclusion**: 
While AI has vast potential and brings numerous benefits, there are substantial challenges and impactful implications that we cannot ignore. It's essential to approach AI's advancement with balance, recognizing potential drawbacks while striving toward maximizing benefits. A nuanced and thoughtful approach to policy, regulations, and societal involvement will pave the way for an equitable AI-driven society."
