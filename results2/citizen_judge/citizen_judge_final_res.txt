                        Agent-A: "Absolutely. In conclusion, I'd like to iterate the main points of my argument:

1. **Citizen Judges' Influence on Judiciary Democracy and Independence**: While the concerns presented by Agent-B are valid, they underline the importance of a rigorous selection and training process for citizen judges to ensure informed decisions without jeopardizing independence or democratization of the judiciary. 

2. **Expertise versus Empathy: Navigating the Complex Terrain of the Courtroom**: We should envision a blended judiciary, where professional legal expertise is complemented by the lived experiences and diverse viewpoints of ordinary citizens. The potential discrepancies raised by Agent-B can be mitigated by rigorous training and the collaborative work of professional judges and citizen judges.

3. **Bias, Diversity, and Equality in the Courtroom**: The introduction of citizen judges serves to make the judiciary more representative and democratic. Concerns about citizen judges interpreting law point towards the necessity of robust training and support from legal experts, rather than rejecting the notion altogether.

4. **Accountability and Efficiency with Citizen Judges' involvement**: Any transitional period has its challenges, but the long-term benefits of a more democratic, accountable, and efficient justice system should not be overlooked. Careful planning and implementation can handle the initial slowdown and potential concerns about oversight and independence.

5. **Global Comparison of Citizen Judge Systems**: The key takeaway from global comparisons is not a direct copy, but learning and adapting successful components while being cognizant of the local cultural, societal, and legal contexts.

The essence of my argument is that the citizen judge system, while not without potential challenges, offers remarkable benefits in terms of democratization, diversity, accountability, and global understanding. These benefits require us to explore ways to mitigate the challenges, rather than disregarding the concept. The debate's objective is not to change the judiciary overnight but to spark thought and exploration towards more inclusion and representation in the justice system."

                        Agent-B: "Absolutely, here are the main points of my counter-arguments for each topic in conclusion:

1. **Citizen Judges Influence on Judiciary Democracy and Independence**: While advocating for democracy and transparency in the judiciary, one cannot disregard the inherent risks of populism and biases in citizen judges. Therefore, the establishment of a robust selection process and further strengthening of the training process for professional judges should be prioritized.

2. **Expertise versus Empathy: Navigating the Complex Terrain of the Courtroom**: While empathy is crucial in the courtroom, a balance must be struck with appropriate legal expertise. The solution isn't necessarily about integrating citizen judges but could also be about making professional judges more attuned to societal issues and needs. Rigorous training for professionals can help achieve this balance.

3. **Bias, Diversity, and Equality in the Courtroom**: While citizen judges might bring more diversity to the table, the risk remains that they can introduce more personal bias into their decisions than professional judges. Therefore, the focus should be on making professional judges more representative of and sensitive to societal diversity and inclusiveness.

4. **Accountability and Efficiency with Citizen Judges involvement**: The transitional period may slow down proceedings that might impact justice delivery adversely. Instead, improving efficiency and accountability within the existing professional system, through various reforms and changes, could be a more balanced and effective approach.

5. **Global Comparison of Citizen Judge Systems**: Global practices can undoubtedly provide valuable lessons. However, the intricate cultural, societal, and legal nuances within each country should be handled with great care. Rather than primarily focusing on adapting practices from abroad, the emphasis should be on home-grown solutions tailored to specific needs and contexts.

In essence, while the concept of a citizen judge system has its potential benefits, it carries substantial challenges that merit careful thought. Instead of a complete overhaul of the system, perhaps a thorough reassessment and modification of the existing judiciary system, to make it more democratic, diverse, and accountable, would be more effective and cautious of approach. This debate indeed sparks thought and exploration towards potential improvements in our justice system.
