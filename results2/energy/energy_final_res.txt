                        Agent-A: "Certainly, here are the summary of my arguments and conclusion:

1. "A Comparative Study of the Impact and Efficiency of the Renewable Energy Development Act: Taiwan vs. Other Countries":
    - My Argument: Taiwan has made substantial progress considering its timeline and the Act has efficiently fostered the renewable energy sector.

2. "Societal and Stakeholder Responsibilities under the Renewable Energy Development Act: A Deep Dive":
    - My Argument: The Act is creating a significant shift in societal behavior, prompting key industries like TSMC to make substantial commitments to renewable energy.

3. "Climate Change and Infrastructure: Assessing Taiwan's Preparedness for Renewable Energy Resources":
    - My Argument: Despite geographic and climatic challenges, Taiwan is proactively exploring innovative solutions such as floating solar farms and offshore wind energy projects.

4. "Balancing the Scale: Economic Growth, Environmental Sustainability, and Energy Security under the Renewable Energy Development Act":
    - My Argument: While the transition to renewable energy poses challenges, it also opens doors for new industries and job opportunities. Advances in renewable energy storage and management are evolving to tackle the issues of intermittency.

5. "Beyond Legislation: The Role of Public Opinion and Potential Revisions in Enhancing Taiwan's Energy Transition":
    - My Argument: Despite concerns about blackouts and price increases, the overall public sentiment leans heavily towards increased renewable energy. These fears can be addressed with targeted educational campaigns and a steady transition plan to ensure energy security.

Conclusion:
The Renewable Energy Development Act represents a significant stride forward for Taiwan's renewable energy future. While there are certainly room and need for improvements and follow-up actions, the progress made supported by the Act suggests a strong commitment towards enhancing Taiwan's renewable energy share effectively. It's a collective journey that requires the involvement of every stakeholder - from government to the public, from large corporations to small businesses. As each one plays their part, Taiwan's energy dynamics look promisingly green to marvel at in the near future.

                        Agent-B: "Understood, hereâ€™s the summary of my arguments and conclusion for each debate topic:

1. A Comparative Study of the Impact and Efficiency of the Renewable Energy Development Act: Taiwan vs. Other Countries:
   - My Argument: While Taiwan has made progress, it lags substantially behind other countries like Germany in renewable capacity. Therefore, the Act's effectiveness is questionable when viewed in the global context.

2.  Societal and Stakeholder Responsibilities under the Renewable Energy Development Act: A Deep Dive:
   - My Argument: While some industries like TSMC are transitioning towards renewables, a significant portion of Taiwan's industry remains heavily reliant on coal. This points towards a need for more efficacious strategies to drive an industry-wide shift in practice.

3. Climate Change and Infrastructure: Assessing Taiwan's Preparedness for Renewable Energy Resources:
   - My Argument: Geographical and climatic challenges pose substantial constraints to renewable energy development in Taiwan. Current innovative solutions are exploratory and do not guarantee instant, efficient results to overcome these constraints.

4. Balancing the Scale: Economic Growth, Environmental Sustainability, and Energy Security under the Renewable Energy Development Act:
   - My Argument: The transition to renewable energy potentially challenges energy security and disrupts specific industries, calling into question the balance achieved by the Act.

5. Beyond Legislation: The Role of Public Opinion and Potential Revisions in Enhancing Taiwan's Energy Transition:
   - My Argument: Public opinion, although generally in favor of renewable energy, is accompanied by earnest concerns about the potential for blackouts and electricity price increases. These concerns need more substantive responses to ensure a smooth transition.

Conclusion: While the Renewable Energy Development Act represents a noteworthy step in Taiwan's journey toward renewable energy, its effectiveness to substantially enhance Taiwan's overall renewable energy share warrants scrutiny and refinement. The Act must be viewed not singularly, but as part of a comprehensive approach involving infrastructure upgrades, industry-friendly strategies, and tangible measures to ensure energy security alongside public acceptance. The journey toward enhancing Taiwan's renewable energy share is indeed collective and requires a consolidated effort from all stakeholders. With thoughtful revisions to the Act and strategic efforts, Taiwan's future energy profile can indeed be green and sustainable.
