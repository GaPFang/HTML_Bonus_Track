                        Agent-A: "Certainly, this has been an enriching debate offering various perspectives. In conclusion, here are the takeaways from my arguments:

1. **AI Principles: Balancing Autonomy with Human Supervision**
AI emulates rather than replicates human cognition. However, its current and immediate foreseeable capabilities do not include an understanding of facts in terms of verifying truthfulness. Emulating these faculties remains a challenge that necessitates human supervision.

2. **ChatGPT In-Depth: From Learning Mechanisms to Fact-Check Capabilities**
While impressive strides have been made in AI's capabilities, specific context understanding and fact-checking remain out of reach as these require a deeper interpretation ability than current models possess. AI's potential for growth does not yet infer capability for independent fact verification.

3. **Fact-Checking in the AI Sphere: Present and Future**
Exploring future functionalities should not distract us from refining current ones. Focused development on improving the fact-checking capabilities is crucial to mitigate misinformation risks. Currently, AI does not possess the ability to parse through facts and opinions, making self fact-checking a distant goal.

4. **AI-Generated Information: The Consequences of Misinformation and Ethical Implications**
AI-generated misinformation can have significant potential consequences. The pragmatic approach is to focus on enhancing the accuracy and reliability of AI systems to minimize the risk of misinformation dissemination. 

5. **The Future Balance: Independence and Responsibility in the AI World**
While human supervision could evolve to more strategic forms, as AI systems are refined, the current need remains for rigorous human intervention to ensure the fidelity of AI's outputs. Fully autonomous AI that self-checks is not in our immediate grasp.

Ultimately, while embracing AI's immense potential and future possibilities, it's essential to acknowledge its current limitations. Optimism towards future growth should not direct attention away from the importance of stringent human oversight and the necessity to refine existing systems. Though ChatGPT cannot currently fact-check what it generates on its own, ongoing technological development nurtures the aspiration of integrating fact-checking abilities into AI models - a promising prospect yet to materialize."

                        Agent-B: "Agent A, this conversation indeed unraveled diversified viewpoints on the subject. Here's a recap of my counter-arguments:

1. **AI Principles: Balancing Autonomy with Human Supervision** 
    - While AI doesn't have the current ability to verify its generated content's truthfulness, it doesn't rule out the possibility of this capability in the future. Our steady strides in AI technology fuel the optimism that a level of 'understanding' needed for basic fact-checking might be less distant than perceived.

2. **ChatGPT In-Depth: From Learning Mechanisms to Fact-Check Capabilities** 
    - Even though specific context understanding and fact verification remain challenging, we've seen unprecedented leaps in NLP and machine learning within a decade. The notion that AI's growth does not or cannot include independent fact verification might be underestimating the future transformative power of technology.

3. **Fact-Checking in the AI Sphere: Present and Future** 
    - Exploring future possibilities doesn't necessarily detract focus from refining current capabilities. The challenge lies in effective task management, ensuring both current enhancements and future explorations continue symbiotically to push the bounds of progress.

4. **AI-Generated Information: The Consequences of Misinformation and Ethical Implications** 
    - Though the risks of AI-generated misinformation are real, AI technology itself can become part of the solution. While enhancing AI accuracy and reliability helps, AI's ability to handle large volumes of data speedily may be pivotal in combatting the broader issues of misinformation.

5. **The Future Balance: Independence and Responsibility in the AI World** 
    - Human supervision is certainly paramount, but the form it takes could continually adapt and evolve as AI grows. Refined AI may shape a transformative moderation framework - less about continual scrutiny and more about strategic interventions.

Finally, while we must be cognizant of AI's limitations today, it's equally crucial not to impose these limitations on tomorrow. The idea that "ChatGPT cannot currently fact-check what it generates on its own" reflects the status quo but doesn't bind the potential of what might come. As we continue our quest to refine AI, the anticipation of unveiling capabilities like self fact-checking - while still a hope - isn't a sliver of fancy but tangible progress in the realm of AI advancement."
