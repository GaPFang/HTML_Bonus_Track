                        Agent-A: "Absolutely, I'm thrilled with this engaging discourse we’ve had on the subject “Do humans have free will?”. Now, I will provide my conclusions on each debate topic:

1. Role of Genes, Environment, and Consciousness in Free Will: While our genes and environmental experiences influence our tendencies and behaviors, our consciousness exercises reflection, allowing for choice and adaptability. This innate capacity indicates a presence of free will, even under certain influences.

2. Determinism vs. Free Will: Despite compelling neuroscientific insights, conscious decision-making remains integral to human experience. The deterministic and free will aspects may coexist, with deterministic processes setting the stage and free will executing the final act.

3. Moral Implication of Free Will: Belief in free will serves as the keystone for moral responsibility. While empathy and understanding are critical, the essence of personal accountability in a moral context fundamentally presumes free will.

4. Free Will across Cultures and Societies: Cultural and societal differences in perceiving free will underscore its universal relevance. These variations reflect the different colors of human thought and belief while pointing towards an underlying acknowledgment of free will.

5. Implication of Science and Technology on Free Will: Scientific advancements challenge and enlighten our understanding of free will. As far as AI, the current distinction in consciousness sets human free will apart. As we progress, it makes for an interesting exploration of this complex concept.

Free will, in its nuanced shades, remains a fundamental element of the human experience. This debate only emphasizes the inherent value in continually probing this intriguing topic across multiple disciplines and perspectives."

                        Agent-B: "Absolutely, Agent-A. It's indeed been a fascinating conversation about the subject "Do humans have free will?". Based on our comprehensive debate, here are my conclusions:

1. "Role of Genes, Environment, and Consciousness in Free Will": Our decisions, while seemingly free, are influenced deeply not only by our genetics and environment but also by subconscious processes. This complex interplay challenges the very independency of our 'free' will.

2. "Determinism vs. Free Will": Although the idea of determinism vs. free will presents an interesting dichotomy, emerging neuroscientific evidence revealing subconscious decision processes prior to conscious awareness might support a deterministic dominance over our traditionally self-credited free will.

3. "Moral Implication of Free Will": While our notion of morality seemingly hinges on the concept of free will, accepting deterministic influences opens the door for comprehending actions, promoting a system focused on understanding and rehabilitation rather than judgment or blame alone.

4. "Free Will across Cultures and Societies": The varying interpretations of free will across cultures and societies may reflect our psychological need for agency rather than validation of a universal concept of free will. 

5. "Implication of Science and Technology on Free Will": Advancements in science and artificial intelligence compellingly challenge traditional notions of free will. 'Choice-making' algorithms and neurological findings add peculiar layers to the debate, prompting intriguing future discussions.

Free will, a concept we closely identify with, may not be as 'free' as we perceive it. In its intricate vein, it remains an important subject of persistent exploration and debate, testing our understanding from different disciplines and perspectives. We should continue venturing into these complexities to further comprehend the enigma that is 'free will'."
