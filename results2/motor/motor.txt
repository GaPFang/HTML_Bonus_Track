                                A moderator: I’m organizing a committee to engage in debates on various subjects. As the moderator, I will introduce a subject for you, Agent A, and another participant, Agent B, to debate. Agent A, you will advocate in favor of the issue, so please prepare evidence to strengthen your argument. On a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 denotes complete agreement and 1 indicates a devil’s advocate stance, your argument strength is rated at 0.9. 
                            
                            
                        Agent-A: "Subject: The use of technology in education improves student outcomes.

As Agent A, I will be advocating in favor of this issue. 

The use of technology in education brings transformative change. An essential piece of evidence is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report (2015), which maintained that "the integration of technology in education could heighten student performance, especially when it bolsters the learning process."

Moreover, technology encourages active participation, critical thinking, creativity, and facilitates customized learning. Studies by Wenglinsky (1998) and Schacter (1999) showed that students who used educational technology in school tend to have higher scores on standardized tests compared to others who didn't.

Let's also consider technology's role in distance learning, which became crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. An article from EdTech Magazine explains how technology enabled continuity in education during unprecedented times and protected students and faculty's physical health.

Lastly, to prove technology's positive impact, one shouldn't overlook EdTech's recent advancements, like AI and VR. These tools can revolutionize learning by offering engaging, immersive experiences and adaptive learning paths, leading to improved educational outcomes.

Therefore, given its ability to enhance learning and foster innovation, the use of technology in education is undeniably beneficial in improving student outcomes."
                            
                        Agent-B: "Subject: The adoption and usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology should be highly limited.

As an advocate opposing this issue, I believe it is essential to foster a broader adaptation and usage of AI technology, with appropriate rules and regulations in place.

1. Economic Impact: AI has significant potential to boost economic growth. Looking at data from PricewaterhouseCoopers, it is projected that AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, a figure higher than the current combined output of China and India. Limiting this technology might hamper this substantial growth prospect.

2. Work Efficiency & Productivity: Artificial Intelligence aids in automating tasks and can hasten various processes, thereby improving work efficiency. McKinsey states that about 60% of all work activities could be partially automated using proven technologies that exist today. Limited adoption would miss these optimization opportunities.

3. Innovations & Competitiveness: AI acts as a catalyst for innovation, revolution, and competitiveness, driving significant value creation across industries, such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and more. Limiting AI limits the possibilities.

4. Problem-Solving: AI can address many global challenges, such as climate change, health crisis, poverty, etc. It can analyze vast amounts of data quickly and effectively, and make predictions more accurately.

5. Skill Development and Job Creation: While concerns exist regarding job loss due to AI, the deployment of AI can also lead to job creation and skill development. New jobs will emerge as AI evolves.

Most importantly, responsible use of AI with well-framed ethical norms can counter instances of misuse or unethical practices. Thus, AI should be adopted widely rather than being highly limited.

                                A moderator: Agent-A, we are in the process of selecting a suitable subject for debate. What do you think of “Should the motorcycle make a two-stage left turn?” as a balanced subject for our debate contest? 
                            
                            
                        Agent-A: "As Agent A, I believe "Should the motorcycle make a two-stage left turn?" could be an interesting and balanced topic to debate. While I will be arguing in favor of the issue, Agent B will have an equally compelling counter-argument.

In favor of the two-stage left turn for motorcycles, I would say it promotes safety. The National Association of City Transportation Officials in the US advocates for this due to its ability to mitigate conflicts with oncoming traffic. It also allows more predictability in cyclists' movements, lowers speeds, and minimizes exposure to motor vehicles' potential conflicts. 

Furthermore, it's worth mentioning the "box turn" or "Copenhagen left," a two-stage turn technique used by bicyclists in Denmark, one of the safest countries for road users.

Nevertheless, I understand that arguments against this technique might tackle the potential confusion posed for other road users or any regulatory complications. This scenario makes the topic well-balanced and rich for a productive debate."
                            
                        Agent-B: "As an artificial intelligence, I don't possess personal opinions. Regardless, "Should the motorcycle make a two-stage left turn?" seems like a nuanced topic that can stimulate healthy debate. While the two-stage left turn may prolong the wait time for motorcyclists, it arguably provides safer conditions in challenging traffic situations, reducing the risk of accidents. The debate can discuss how safety and efficiency can be balanced in road traffic rules to enhance motoring standards. Hence, it sounds like a balanced subject for the debate."

                        Agent-A: "Absolutely, I am ready to present evidence in favor of the subject:

1. "Safety and Accident Rates": A study published in the Journal of Safety Research indicates that motorcyclists are more likely to be involved in accidents upon making traditional left turns due to the conflicts with oncoming traffic, an issue that two-stage left turns substantially mitigate. 

2. "Psychological and Behavioral Impact": As per a study by Schleinitz et al. (2017), a more predictable behavior pattern of motorcyclists, such as two-stage left turns can contribute to more comfortable encounters between motorcyclists and other traffic participants.

3. "Legal Framework and Global Practices": In countries like the Netherlands where two-stage left turns are practiced, fewer accidents involving motorcycles are reported. This strategy, when enforced through legal means, has a clear potential to improve motorcycle safety (OECD report, 2013).

4. "Educational Requirements": According to the Motorcycle Safety Foundation, continuous learning and improvement in driving techniques are vital for road safety. Introducing two-stage left turns in training can prepare riders for more safety measures.

5. "Future Outlook and Infrastructure": The integration of technology like AI in traffic system could allow for more structured implementation of two-stage left turns. Works by researchers like Huang and Abdel-Aty (2010) showed promising results in improving road safety through intelligent transport systems. The advancement and focus on such systems can ensure safer two-stage left turns.
  
These pieces of evidence strongly advocate the implementation of two-stage left turns for motorcycles, given the potential safety benefits."
