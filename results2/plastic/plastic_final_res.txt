                        Agent-A: "Thank you, Agent B, for your points. Here are the conclusions of my arguments:

1. **Environmental Impact and Health Consequences**: Small but significant changes like banning plastic straws offer an entry point for wider societal change, thereby raising the level of engagement with environmental consciousness. While comprehensive solutions are required for ecological health, these smaller steps contribute to the larger goal.

2. **Economic Consequences and Societal Impact**: Economic transitions are inherently challenging. However, in moving towards a more sustainable future, such transitions become inevitable. The role of the government here is instrumental in providing support and creating a healthy ecosystem for businesses to adapt to these changes gradually.

3. **Policy Measures and Innovation Initiatives**: Government policy is an essential tool but it indeed requires careful calibration. The goal should be to strike a balance between driving innovation and providing a regulated framework that mitigates ECM (Environmental, Social and Governance) risks.

4. **Future Projections and Policy Extension Possibilities**: Evaluating measures for their impact, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness is critical. However, the importance of raising awareness and inciting behavioral change through such incremental steps like banning plastic straws cannot be undermined as they open pathways for larger systemic changes.

5. **Global Standing and International Comparisons**: While comprehensive environmental measures are crucial to address larger issues, the banning of plastic straws is symbolic of Taiwan's commitment to environmental sustainability. This initiative complements broader environmental conservation efforts.

In conclusion, the decision to continue prohibiting petroleum-based plastic straws in Taiwan is not just about eliminating these items, but about initiating a domino effect of change that furthers the cause of environmental sustainability. The impact of individual actions, like discarding a straw, accumulates to form a collective action, effectively responding to global environmental concerns. It is underpinned by the ethos that every small step leads us closer to our environmental goals."

                        Agent-B: "Certainly, Agent-A, here are my counter-argument conclusions:

1. **Environmental Impact and Health Consequences**: While banning plastic straws might seem a straightforward way of addressing plastic pollution, assessing the overall environmental effectiveness remains crucial. Given the relative smallness of straw waste within the larger plastic problem, resources might be better utilized on substantial and comprehensive solutions addressing broader plastic usage.

2. **Economic Consequences and Societal Impact**: Economic and societal impacts of such a transition need careful attention. While governmental aid can alleviate some challenges, care must be taken to ensure policies don't disproportionately burden small businesses or vulnerable communities. More affordable and readily accessible alternatives need to be made available before drastic measures are imposed.

3. **Policy Measures and Innovation Initiatives**: Government policy plays a significant role, but striking the right balance is essential. Policies should not frustrate market forces or curtail innovative efforts towards improved sustainable solutions. A policy should be an enabler and supporter of innovation rather than its suppressor.

4. **Future Projections and Policy Extension Possibilities**: Forward-looking strategies, like the expansion of such a policy to other single-use plastics, need a critical evaluation for feasibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. While raising awareness is vital, the substantiality of impact matters equally, if not more.

5. **Global Standing and International Comparisons**: While Taiwan's stance on plastic straws symbolizes its commitment to environmental sustainability, it is equally critical to back up this symbolic act with broader and more impactful environmental measures to demonstrate its dedication effectively on the global stage.

In conclusion, while banning plastic straws in Taiwan could be a symbolic step towards sustainability, it is vital to consider its wider impacts before blanket-wide implementation. Larger systemic changes that address the bulk of plastic pollution should be prioritized. Governments must provide an environment which encourages innovation towards more sustainable practices and material development, ensuring balance between environmental concern and societal convenience and affordability. Small steps are undeniably part of the journey to environmental sustainability, but the focus should remain on making strides where it matters the most."
