                        Agent-A: "Sure, let's sum up my arguments supporting the system of plea bargaining:

1. **Impacts on Recidivism and Efficiency** - Plea bargaining incurs substantial efficiencies that mitigate the load on our overwhelmed justice system. Regarding recidivism, evidence shows that undue severity of punishments might not deliver the desired deterrent effect, and that mitigation, especially for non-serious and first-time offenders, can help reintegrate these individuals into society.

2. **Justice, Fairness, and Socio-economic Class** - Plea bargaining does pose challenges to fairness based on socio-economic classes. However, the system isn’t inherently biased. Society's obligation is towards equal access to legal counsel and information which can ensure plea bargains serve all defendants effectively. 

3. **Efficacy of Plea Bargains versus Full Trials** - Plea bargaining allows defendants to reduce the uncertainty and risk inherent in full trials. Although it can be seen as pressure, this "reality-check" also provides defendants with a sobering assessment of their case based on the prosecution’s belief in their guilt.

4. **Ethics, Morals, and Plea Bargaining** - While there’s the potential for power misuse in plea bargaining, it also offers defendants a choice, a say in their own fate that they might lack in a full trial. Power imbalances can be deeply rectified through rigorous oversight, accountability, and enforcement of regulations.

5. **Psychological Impact and Socioeconomic Implications** - The psychological pressure of plea bargaining cannot be denied but can be mitigated through comprehensive support systems. The socioeconomic disparities in the justice system do exist, but the answer lies in wider legal reforms, not solely within the confines of plea bargaining.

To conclude, the plea bargaining system, while not without its flaws, contributes to procedural efficiencies, gives defendants control over their outcomes, and balances the justice system. It shouldn't be discarded based on potential or occasional misuse. Instead, our attention should be towards continually refining its processes, safeguards and support systems to make it more fair and robust. It's a tool in our legal system's kit and, like every tool, it requires careful use, persistent monitoring, and regular honing. The question shouldn't be if plea bargaining should remain, but how we can make it serve justice better."

                        Agent-B: "I understand Agent A's persuasive arguments on the necessity and benefits of plea bargaining. Here are my concluding remarks to counter these points:

1. **Impacts on Recidivism and Efficiency** - While plea bargaining might alleviate some burdens on an overtaxed justice system, expediency shouldn't undercut justice. The 'efficiency' gained could result in unjust outcomes. Additionally, while mitigated punishment might aid some offenders' reintegration, it could also dilute the severity of the justice system triggering potential recidivism.

2. **Justice, Fairness, and Socio-economic Class** - It's true that society should ensure equal access to legal counsel, but this principle doesn't alter the inherent bias in plea bargaining—the system magnifies these disparities. Laws must defend the most vulnerable, not compound their disadvantages.

3. **Efficacy of Plea Bargains versus Full Trials** - Plea bargaining introduces a fresh set of risks by pushing defendants to concede guilt prematurely with the threat of harsher sentences. The ‘sobering assessment’ it presents often is a byproduct of coercion rather than a perception of guilt.

4. **Ethics, Morals, and Plea Bargaining** - Plea bargaining's choice offers a double-edged sword—it gives defendants a voice while also offering opportunities for exploitation. The quest for justice shouldn't forget that prosecutors hold inherent power advantages in negotiations. 

5. **Psychological Impact and Socioeconomic Implications** - Comprehensive support systems are essential, but the psychological toll plea bargaining takes on defendants cannot be understated. Wider legal reforms are necessary but overlooking plea bargaining's exacerbation of socioeconomic disparities is problematic as well.

In conclusion, while plea bargaining may offer a pragmatic solution to real-world challenges in our justice system, its inherent issues—potential for coercion, amplification of socioeconomic disparities, ethical conflicts, potential incursion of justice—cannot be dismissed. Instead of asking how we can make plea bargaining better serve justice, we should also question if plea bargaining, by its very nature, may be at times antithetical to justice. The debate deserves careful and ongoing scrutiny—true justice demands no less."
