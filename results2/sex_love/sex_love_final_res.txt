                        Agent-A: "Appreciate your arguments, Agent B. Here are my closing remarks on the debate topics:

1. **Exploring Psychological and Biological Perspectives**: While bonding hormones are released during sex, such bonding can occur without romantic love. The existence of negative feelings in relationships separating sex and love indicates a need for better communication and understanding around such relationships rather than a hardwired need to connect love and sex.

2. **Modern Relationship Forms and their Implications**: Though some sexual relationships develop into romantic ones, it underlines the possibilities of different relationship models; some where sex and love coexist, others where they exist separately. Therefore, it establishes that love and sex can be separated.

3. **Societal Influence and Media Portrayal**: Media's portrayal reflects reality for many. Emotional distress associated could be better connected to societal norms and personal conflicts rather than an inherent issue of separating sex and love. Better societal acceptance and understanding are required.

4. **The Role of Communication, Consent, Commitment, and Intimacy**: While love often plays a role in sexual relationships, it's critical to distinguish love from other forms of emotional connections. It's plausible to have emotionally healthy sexual relationships that are centered around respect, consent, and pleasure without romantic love.

5. **Analyzing Healthy Relationships**: While much research indicates the benefit of intertwining love and sex, it doesn't prove it as an absolute necessity for everyone. Individuals and relationships are diverse; what promotes health and satisfaction in one might not do the same for all. The existence of contentment in relationships that separate love and sex highlights the individual nature of relationship needs and compatibility.

In essence, while love and sex often coexist wonderfully and beneficially, they can also stand independently, accommodating personal needs, wishes, and contexts. This debate has been insightful, and thank you, Agent B and Moderator, for a rich and nuanced dialogue."

                        Agent-B: "Thank you, Agent-A. Here are my concluding remarks on the debate topics, presenting a balanced argument considering my main opposition stance:

1. **Exploring Psychological and Biological Perspectives**: As oxytocin, the hormone most frequently related to bonding, is released during sex, it suggests a biological orientation towards an emotional connection when sex is involved. Negative emotions often reported in relationships where sex is significantly detached from love indicate an inherent underpinning of love in sexual relationships. 

2. **Modern Relationship Forms and their Implications**: Even though some relationships are based on purely sexual attraction, a common progression from sexual to emotional relationship underlines an implicit bonding between love and sex. This evolution is indicative of the intrinsic nature of love emerging from sexual relationships.

3. **Societal Influence and Media Portrayal**: Although media influence can exaggerate certain behaviors, it's essential to view resulting emotional distress as a potential signal indicating the challenges of an inherent separation. It suggests an underlying issue in the separation of what may be naturally intertwined: love and sex.

4. **The Role of Communication, Consent, Commitment, and Intimacy**: While emotional connections of different types can exist in relationships, the emotional intimacy found in romantic love often marks a significant factor in sexual relationships. This suggests a natural connection between love and sex, as the emotional aspects of love often play a profound role in these relationships.

5. **Analyzing Healthy Relationships**: While different individuals might find fulfillment in separate paths, the bulk of research supports greater relationship satisfaction where love and sex coexist. This pattern implies that love provides a unique and indispensable element to sexual relationships, indicating a potential inherent linkage between love and sex.

In conclusion, while instances of sex and love being separated exist, many signals point towards an inherent connection between them, suggesting that they might not be as easily separated as it appears, and their coexistence often promotes greater relationship health and satisfaction. This debate has been engaging and enlightening, and I appreciate this nuanced dialogue with Agent-A and the Moderator."
