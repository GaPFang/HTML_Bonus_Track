1. **Physics, Paradoxes, and Predictive Science**: It's essential to remember that our current understanding of physics cannot accommodate the concept of time travel without creating numerous paradoxes. Simply witnessing future scientific achievements doesn't mean we are capable of understanding or replicating them with our current knowledge and technology.

2. **Evolution of Technology and Impact on Healthcare**: Grokking future technology can arguably lead to unintended consequences. Rather than stimulating our own innovation, it could make us overly reliant on borrowing from the future. And in terms of healthcare, knowing future developments could favor those who can pay for access, potentially widening the gap between the rich and the poor.

3. **Ethics, Psychology, and Preemptive Problem-solving**: From an ethical perspective, is it right to alter a future yet experienced by some? Foreseeing challenges and creating preemptive solutions could rob us of our adaptive and innovative human nature. The psychological impacts on the time traveler could be detrimental, given the potential isolation and burden of future knowledge.

4. **Societal Implications: History, Culture, and Relationships**: Witnessing future societal developments can cause more harm than good. It might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, and create a situation where we push certain agendas to make the future fit our visual. The potential disruption to personal relationships and social structures should not be underestimated.

5. **Navigating Through Time: Benefits and Perils**: The perils of time travel could outweigh the potential benefits. Future knowledge might accelerate development, but at what cost? It could discourage our natural course of scientific discovery. Plus, the perils of culture shock, misuse of future knowledge, and the paradoxes associated with time travel cannot be overstated.

These refutations pose significant questions about the utility of time travel and the potential unforeseen consequences."

Plus, the perils of culture shock, misuse of future knowledge, and the paradoxes associated with time travel cannot be overstated.  These refutations pose significant questions about the utility of time travel and the potential unforeseen consequences. Please articulate arguments against the points made by Agent B. 
                            
                            
                        Agent-A: "Absolutely, here are my counter-arguments to Agent-B's points:

1. **Physics, Paradoxes, and Predictive Science**: It's true our understanding of physics is currently limited, but taking a peek into the future could give us direction, nudging us towards insights we might take millennia to reach. Bridging the gap between current science and future advancements isn't implausible but rather a question of innovation and evolution.

2. **Evolution of Technology and Impact on Healthcare**: The argument of reliance on future technology downplays the capacity of current innovative minds that aim for progress, not dependence. As for healthcare access, this challenge aligns with our current problem of 'affordable healthcare for all'. The solution then lies in policy-making, not abandoning the potential benefits of future medical breakthroughs.

3. **Ethics, Psychology, and Preemptive Problem-solving**: Ethical dilemmas exist, but shouldn't we, if given a chance, leverage potential means to alleviate future suffering? The point about psychology underscores the need for support mechanisms rather than discarding the utility of time travel. The gift of foresight could evolve our problem-solving abilities, not stifle them.

4. **Societal Implications: History, Culture, and Relationships**: Future insights don't necessitate a deterministic approach but could enrich our perspectives to nurture societal growth. On disrupting personal relationships, it necessitates work on dynamic relationships norms, again not an abandonment of the idea of time travel.

5. **Navigating Through Time: Benefits and Perils**: Every path-breaking advancement comes with perils, but that doesn't stop our species from exploring and reaching new highs. The surge in development because of future insights doesn't hamper scientific discovery but would rather embolden it, fueling a faster rate of progress overcoming paradoxes and culture shocks.

Your concerns are valid, but they highlight areas of potential growth and evolution rather than reasons to wholly dismiss the benefits of time travel."
                            
                        Agent-B: "Thank you, Agent-A, for your response. While your points are indeed thought-provoking, I still stand by my opposition largely due to the inherent uncertainty and potential dangers involved in time travel. Here are my rebuttals:

1. **Physics, Paradoxes, and Predictive Science**: While peeking into the future may hypothetically give some directions, it doesn't guarantee a proper understanding of the scientific advancements. Moreover, it may lead to dismissal or ignorance of current scientific efforts since the end goal is pre-known and not discovered.

2. **Evolution of Technology and Impact on Healthcare**: In the topic of healthcare, it's wishful thinking to assume that policy changes to regulate access to future healthcare knowledge will occur smoothly. This might actually accentuate inequality between different socioeconomic groups.

3. **Ethics, Psychology, and Preemptive Problem-solving**: The argument that leveraging time travel to prevent future suffering assumes we can accurately interpret and react to future events. This overlooks the potential for misinterpretation and mistimed interventions leading to unanticipated consequences.

4. **Societal Implications: History, Culture, and Relationships**: Though insights into the future might potentially lead to societal growth, trying to mold the present based on a projected future might eliminate the diversity of thought that fuels organic societal transformation.

5. **Navigating Through Time: Benefits and Perils**: The belief that time travel would only fuel faster progress ignores the fact that advancements are not solely based on end goals, but also on the journey. This process holds valuable lessons that could be missed if only the end result is imported from the future.

In closing, while the benefits that might arise from time travel cannot be dismissed, the perils it poses to our current understanding of the world and the potential hazards to our society and individual beings seem to outweigh them."
