                        Agent-A: "Indeed, let's summarize and conclude:

1. Economic Impact and Dependency: While crises can impact tourism, its economic contributions cannot be overlooked. The sector's inherent diversity provides resilience. For economies overly dependent on tourism, the need is to develop resilience strategies rather than abandoning tourism.

2. Environmental Implications: As with any human activity, tourism has an environmental cost. However, the shift towards sustainable practices and eco-tourism can help leverage this sector for conservation. Countries like Costa Rica and Kenya have successfully utilized tourism for conservation, offering inspiration for other regions.

3. Cultural Preservation Vs Erosion: Tourism can help in preserving and rejuvenating disappearing cultural practices. While there is a risk of exploitation, it arises from poorly regulated tourism rather than tourism per se. Well-structured tourism with community involvement can indeed boost cultural preservation, as seen in Bhutan's 'High Value, Low Impact' model.

4. Infrastructure Development and Strain: Infrastructure created due to tourism often benefits local communities. Adequate regulation can mitigate resource over-utilization and social displacement. Taxes from tourism can be reinvested back into maintaining and improving infrastructure, leading to a cycle of positive development.

5. Social Changes and Disruptions: While tourism can cause social disruptions, it can be managed via effective policy like resident-oriented strategies from Amsterdam. Proper regulation and policy enforcement can help strike a balance.

Tourism – like any industry – has its challenges, yet it brings significant societal, cultural, environmental, and economic benefits. The pressing need is not to discard tourism due to its potential pitfalls, but to embrace and amplify sustainable tourism practices that allow us to harness its positive power. Rather than asking if tourism is more harmful than beneficial, the question should be how we can make tourism beneficial for all stakeholders involved."

                        Agent-B: "Absolutely, here are the concluding counter-arguments:

1. Economic Impact and Dependency: While it's true that tourism contributes significantly to economies, over-reliance can place economies at risk, particularly in times of global crises. Enhancing resilience should include reducing over-dependency rather than solely diversifying within the sector.

2. Environmental Implications: The growth of sustainable tourism isn't keeping pace with the rapid environmental degradation caused by broader tourism practices. While there are successful models like Costa Rica or Kenya, they are the exception rather than the norm.

3. Cultural Preservation Vs Erosion: The risk of cultural commodification through tourism is real and widespread. Even with community involvement, the delicate balance of preserving authenticity while catering to tourists is often not maintained, as seen in numerous cases worldwide.

4. Infrastructure Development and Strain: Infrastructure developed due to tourism often over-utilizes local resources and can lead to social displacement. The reinvestment of tourism taxes often fails to cover the negative social and environmental costs borne by locals.

5. Social Changes and Disruptions: Social disruption is a significant impact of tourism. Despite policies in some places, many tourist destinations suffer from increased living costs, crime, and societal displacement, demonstrating that tourism management still has a long way to go.

While tourism has the potential for positive impacts, it is critical to weigh them against the significant negative impacts experienced by many of the local communities and environments most affected by tourism. A shift of focus towards sustainable tourism is crucial, not just in theory, but in widespread, tangible practice. Instead of asking how we can harness the 'positive power' of tourism, we should be asking how we can mitigate its manifold negative impacts to make it truly beneficial for all stakeholders."
