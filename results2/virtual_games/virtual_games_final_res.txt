                        Agent-A: "As the debate draws to a close, we've thoroughly examined the complexities surrounding the issue of spending on virtual games. Here are my concluding remarks:

1. Economic Impact and Value Assessment of Virtual Gaming: Despite concerns about in-game purchases like loot boxes, the economic influence of the gaming industry is evident. As issues arise, the industry has shown a capacity to address and regulate such matters. Continued vigilance is necessary to ensure fair practices. 

2. Social Impact and Personal Effects of Virtual Games: While excessive gameplay can lead to isolation, the converse of such interaction forms a robust, global online community. The key lies in striking a balance between virtual interaction and real-world social engagement, promoting healthy gaming habits.

3. Skill Development and Educational Relevance of Gaming: Although potential pitfalls are attached to younger players, the constructive value of gaming in skill development and education should not be understated. As education methods evolve, the integration of interactive learning into mainstream education could prove beneficial.

4. Spending Comparison: Physical Goods vs Digital Assets: While physical goods provide tangible value, the intangible value derived from gaming – joy, excitement, social interaction – is just as real to gamers, providing a product they're willing to pay for.

5. Mental Health and Gaming: Gaming can both contribute to and relieve mental health problems. However, the same can be said of many activities - too much of anything can be harmful. It reaffirms the call for moderation, responsible gaming, and the need for more research in this domain.

Virtual gaming, like any industry, has its share of challenges and controversies, but its economic, social, and educational benefits underscore its significant positive value. So, in response to the subject "Is the spending on virtual games meaningless?", I conclude that, while vigilance and moderation are required, the spending on virtual games is not meaningless, but rather a legitimate expenditure for entertainment, social interaction, and even education.

                        Agent-B: "Sure, as this debate concludes, I present my concluding remarks on each topic:

1. Economic Impact and Value Assessment of Virtual Gaming: While the economic significance of the gaming industry is undeniable, the ethical and psychological implications of practices such as loot box purchases call for extreme caution. A truly sustainable and responsible industry must prioritize user welfare above profit.

2. Social Impact and Personal Effects of Virtual Games: The formation of virtual communities through gaming has its value, but it should not eclipse the importance of real-world social engagement. Balancing the virtual and real is crucial and the gaming industry needs to play its part in fostering such balance.

3. Skill Development and Educational Relevance of Gaming: Though gaming can play a role in education and skill development, it should not replace traditional learning methods. Reliance on gaming for educational growth can limit the holistic development of younger players, pointing to the need for moderation and judgement.

4. Spending Comparison: Physical Goods vs Digital Assets: While intangible returns from gaming are treasured by players, the tangible utility of physical goods provide more reliable and enduring value. The ephemeral nature of digital purchases in gaming raises concerns about worth and longevity.

5. Mental Health and Gaming: Gaming can indeed serve as a stress-relief tool but the thin line between moderate play and addiction poses a high-risk factor for players, underscoring the need for more research and preventative measures to promote mental well-being.

To the subject, “Is the spending on virtual games meaningless?”, I conclude that it is not entirely meaningless, but the inherent risks attached necessitate mindful consumption. The gaming industry should demonstrate greater responsibility in ensuring beneficial and safe gaming experiences. Expenditure on virtual games should consider this delicate balance."
